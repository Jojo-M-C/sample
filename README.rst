The Hitchhiker's Guide to Frequent Problems 
=======================================

“Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist's, but that's just peanuts to space.”
― Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

Now swap "space" for "the internet". 

Hi! Glad you made it here. This is my personal website where I document a lot of the stuff I do and find useful. Feel free to look around :)
