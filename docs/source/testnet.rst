Eth testnets 
=========

`Ropsten`_	
------
The only proof-of-work testnet. It has unpredictable block times and frequent chain reorganizations. At the same time, it is the chain that most closely resembles mainnet. (id=3)

`Rinkeby`_
----------
A proof-of-authority network. This means that new blocks are added by a set of pre-defined trusted nodes, instead of by whichever miner provides a proof-of-work. It only works with Geth clients, and has 15-second block times. (id=4)

`Kovan`_	
-------
Another proof-of-authority network, but this one runs only with OpenEthereum clients, and has 4-second block times. (id=42)

`Goerli`_	
------
Also a proof-of-authority network, but compatible with both Geth and OpenEthereum clients, with 15-second block times. (id=5)
